/**
 * Type wrapper for an unsigned char that represents the
 * hash of an operand identifier. Used as a value for comparison
 * against the operand identity encoder lookup table. The individual
 * bits of the byte represent the type of operands within the
 * operand identifier as follows:
 *
 * 0: Relative operand (rel8/16/32)
 * 1: Register operand (r8/16/32/64)
 * 2: Immediate operand (imm8/16/32/64)
 * 3: Memory operand (m8/16/32/64)
 *
 * 4-7: Reserved for future use
 *
 * A bit set to 1 indicates that the operand is of the corresponding
 * type, while a bit set to 0 indicates that the operand is not of the
 * corresponding type.
 *
 * @note Not to be confused with the operand types (`enum operands`)
 *
 * Also, there are macros below to help you!
