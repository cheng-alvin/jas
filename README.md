<p align="center" padding="10px"> Jas is a minimal, fast and simple zero-dependency assembler for the x64 family of processors, it comes packaged with tonnes of useful utility functions targeted for implementing into compilers, operating systems and JIT interpreters and other types of utility applications that need compilation to ELF or just a plain encoded buffer. </p>

- Supports **60+** instructions!
- Assembles x86, x64 or 16-bit code
- Outputs **ELF object files**
- Unparalleled size and efficiency!

### ‚ö°Quick start
First of all, install/link against the binary releases [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/releases)* or build it from source with following the instructions below. Jas takes instructions in an array in a struct form defined in [instruction.h](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/0faa905be7cb1238796af46552b3271a11b4e2dd/libjas/instruction.h) and passes it to a `assemble_instr()` function which generates the the actual buffer of an array of `uint8_t` for you to process. (However, in this situation, we are using the `instr_gen()` function and operand generation macros to generate the instruction structure automatically without the janky C structure syntax)
```c
#include <jas.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  instruction_t *instr = instr_gen(INSTR_MOV, 2, r64(REG_RAX), imm64(0));
  buffer_t buf = assemble_instr(MODE_LONG, instr);

  /* Do something to `buf.data` - The uint8_t array */

  instr_free(instr);
  free(buf.data);
  return 0;
}
```

Yeah! that's it! Seriously! It's that simple, this little snippet of code generates and encodes a  `mov rax, 0` instruction.

> Since the returned buffer is in the form of a dynamically allocated pointer, care must be taken to `free` and manage the block of memory.

### üí° Why Jas?
Jas is a very versatile library, it opens the door for generating low level assembly and ELF object files to us average programers, suddenly, we can use write our own compilers from scratch, without the complexities of LLVM or compiling down to a GCC backend. Jas is optimized to speed and complexity, as well as size, allowing it to be used in small-scale compilers and interpreters where compile time matters.

[brainfry](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/brainfry) is a project I wrote during the weekend and is simple Brainf*ck compiler that compiled down to raw machine code, it performed well and only weighed in at a couple KiBs big, leading to immensely quick compile times. Jas severely simplified the development process as anything written using LLVM or GCC backends would consist of long compile-times and huge binary sizes.

### üèóÔ∏è Build and install
The very first step in doing anything with jas is to build and link the library against your application code, since jas is a library. Ensure you have a C99 and C++17 compiler installed (Anything will do, preferably `clang`), a Javascript runner (such as `node`) for building the `instructions.tbl` file, as well as GNU `make` or something to run makefile for running the build script
To obtain the Jas source files, run:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/
```

Now, you should have a folder named `jas` in your current directory, now you can just simply run `make` within that directory like so:
(Some directories and folders can be missing, you must run `make clean` before you actually build the library.)

``` bash
cd jas # Change into the cloned directory
make clean # Clean directory and setup
make # Build source code
```

Voila! Now you have a built copy of Jas in the `build` folder, just simply copy and link against the archive to start building your dream compiler or assembler frontend!

### üìù Licensing 
All the code under the Jas assembler project repository is licensed under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) which is a popular open-source license for projects like this! Please see [LICENSE](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/main/LICENSE) for the details.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing / reporting bugs
No software is perfect, nor is Jas. As the assembler is written in C, many security issues may arise, causing issues across the program. It's a shared responsibility to safeguard Jas of all developers, contributors and users alike. Please report all security or any other concerns in a timely manner via email to the official mailing list: jas-assembler@google-groups.com.

However, for developers interested and passionate about assemblers and low-level programming, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/a02fea10d9d398ef63a9fc9419ce54d8b406c3a5/CONTRIBUTING.txt) in the home directory for more information on how to contribute code to the repository! 

All changes and reports are welcome, no matter how big or small your changes are :-)
