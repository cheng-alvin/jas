<p align="center" padding="10px"> Jas is a minimal, fast and simple zero-dependency assembler for the x64 family of processors, jas not only aims to be fast and simple when using it but also aims to be a learning reasource for others to learn about low-level system programming and the x64 instruction set. Useful for implementing into compilers, operating systems and JIT interpreters and other types of utilites that need compilation to ELF or just a plain enocded buffer. </p>

### ‚ö°Quick start
First of all, install/link against the binary releases [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/releases) or build it from source with following the instructions below. Jas takes instructions in an array in a struct form defined in [instruction.h](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/0faa905be7cb1238796af46552b3271a11b4e2dd/libjas/instruction.h) and passes it to a `codegen()` function which generates the the actual buffer of an array of `uint8_t` for you to process.
```c
#include <jas.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  instruction_t instr[] = (instruction_t[]) {
      (instruction_t){
          .instr = INSTR_MOV,
          .operands = (operand_t[]){
              (operand_t){.type = OP_R64, .data = &(enum registers){REG_RAX}},
              (operand_t){.type = OP_IMM64, .data = &(uint64_t){0}},
              OP_NONE,
              OP_NONE,
          },
      },
  };

  buffer_t buf = codegen(MODE_LONG, instr, sizeof(instr), CODEGEN_RAW);

  /* Do something to `buf.data` - The uint8_t array */

  free(buf.data);
  return 0;
}
```

Yeah! that's it! Seriously! It's that simple, this little snippet of code generates and encodes a  `mov rax, 0` instruction.

> Since the returned buffer is in the form of a dynamically allocated pointer, care must be taken to `free` and manage the block of memory.

### üèóÔ∏è Build and install
The very first step in doing anything with jas is to build and link the library against your application code, since jas is a library. Ensure you have a C99 and C++17 compiler installed (Anything will do, preferably `clang`), and GNU make or something to run makefile while buidling. 

> Since all the build scripts are written in bash, we only support building from POSIX-compliant systems such as Linux or Mac. 

To obtain the Jas source files, run:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/
```

Now, you should have a folder named `jas` in your current directory, now you can just simply run `make` within that directory like so:
(Some directories and folders can be missing, you must run `make clean` before you actually build the library.)

``` bash
cd jas # Change into the cloned directory
make clean # Clean directory and setup
make # Build source code
```

Voila! Now you have a built copy of Jas in the `build` folder, just simply copy and link against the archive to start building your dream compiler or assembler frontend!

### üìù Licensing 
All the code under the Jas assembler project repository is licensed under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) which is a popular open-source license for projects like this! Please see [LICENSE](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/main/LICENSE) for the details.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing / Security issues
No software is perfect, nor is Jas. As the assembler is written in C, many secuity issues may arise, causing issues across the program. It's a shared responsibility to safeguard Jas of all developers, contributers and users alike. Please report all secuity concerns in a timely manner via email or the means provided [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/dev/SECURITY.md). 

However, for developers interested and passionate about assemblers and low-level programming, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/a02fea10d9d398ef63a9fc9419ce54d8b406c3a5/CONTRIBUTING.txt) in the home directory for more information on how to contribute code to the repository! 

All changes and reports are welcome, no matter how big or small your changes are :-)
