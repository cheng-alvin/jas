## Security and safety
We value security of our assembler, nothing's perfect, and we acknowledge that there
can be security vulnerabilities inside our code. Therefore, please follow the 
guidelines to report vulnerabilities and critical security issues. We'll aim to get
back to any security issue or vulnerability within 7 days of submission.

### How to report?
Some vulnerabilities are critical and people may use it to their advantage go affect
the stable versions, that means, some vulnerabilities must be reported by the means
of email and other more private ways to prevent it from leaking into the hands of 
"bad-actors". This table below outlines the methods of reporting security 
vulnerabilities to the Jas assembler.
